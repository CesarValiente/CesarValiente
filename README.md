## Hi there, I'm Cesar, nice to meet you! 👋 😊

I'm a software engineer 👨‍💻 currently working [@Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) on the **[Surface Duo Developer Experience team](https://docs.microsoft.com/surface-duo/)** 📱📱, where I work on different areas, with the goal to help developers worldwide to build dual-screen and foldable experiences.

As my 🌜 job, I lead the **Android@Microsoft** community where we run multiple activities that that help all Android teams in the company, to connect and share knowledge.
If you want to read and learn how we do Android, just go to our very own [Microsoft Mobile Engineering](https://medium.com/microsoft-mobile-engineering) publication.
